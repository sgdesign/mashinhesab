## LucasL

```
LucasL(n)
```

> gives the `n`th Lucas number.

Lucas numbers satisfy a recurrence relation similar to that of the Fibonacci sequence, in which each term is the sum of the preceding two. They are generated by choosing the initial values `LucasL(0) = 2` and `LucasL(1) = 1`.

### Examples

```
>> LucasL(10)
123
```
